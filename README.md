# Encryption

I would like to see encryption added to Notepad++. 
When I use EXCEL, I can encrypt the file. Each time I open the file I enter the password and I make changes and save the file and it is still encrypted.  

Minim requirement: 
So add a save as option to encrypt the saved file.  
The next time you open it you have to enter the password. 
And because it was encrypt when it was opened, it will be encrypted when closed, unless you use a different save as option.  

Possible maximum security: 
Encrypt the application "notepad++" with a master password. 
When you open Notepad++ you would have to inter the Master password. 
While operating in this mode, every file saved would be encrypted with the master password, even if it was not encrypted when opened, unless you use a different save as option.  

In my case I carry around a flash drive with customer data and I'm always afraid that I will lose it. 
I also do not like putting files on the cloud that are not encrypted. 
There are ways to do encryption now, but it becomes a multi step process to work with files. 
If encryption were built into Notepad++ things would be a lot easier. 
Other then EXCEL and WORD I know of no other editor application with built in encryption.  
I love Notepad++ and use it for all text and script files. I love that it is free and I have made a donation. 
But if you add encryption to Notepad++, I would be willing to buy a subscription.
